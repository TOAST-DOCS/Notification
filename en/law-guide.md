## Guide to Notice of Personal Information Consignee
When you (the "Customer") use Notification products (Push, Email, SMS, KakaoTalk Bizmessage), work consignment relationship related to processing of personal information is created between the Customer and us (the "Company"). As per the Information Communications Network Act and Personal Information Protection Act, the Customer as a consigner must reveal the status on how it has consigned the personal information (consignee and description of work) to the Company through the privacy policy. Accordingly, the Company may guide the Customer as follows when they are using the SMS product of NHN Cloud, so that they would comply with the related laws not to be subject to any kinds of disadvantages, such as a fine, as the result of not revealing the consignment status.

### Example
Before using any of the Notification products, the Customer must display the following information on their 'Privacy Policy' > Consignment Status page.
```
[Notice of Personal Information Consignee]
Consignee: NHN
Description of work: Sending push messages, emails, text messages, and KakaoTalk Bizmessages for the consigner

### Notes
#### Display of the Advertisement
- When displaying the advertisement, it must be displayed as Advertisement without any manipulation in the method of display such as inserting empty spaces, signs, or any other characters.

#### Name of the Sender
- The name of the company, service, etc. that are easily identifiable by the recipient can be used.

#### Contact Information of the Sender
- If the sender cannot be contacted directly and guides another contact, or if the contact information listed is not reachable, or if the contact information is false, it may be considered that the contact information is not indicated.
- The email address cannot be used as the contact information in other media except for email.

#### Measures and Methods for Easily Expressing Intent to Opt Out or Withdraw Consent
- The measures and methods for easily expressing intent to opt out or withdraw consent must be written and specifically revealed in the body of the advertisement, and it will be regarded as not being indicated if opt-out or withdrawal of consent is not made or impossible by the specified measures and methods.
- Requiring additional measures, such as logging in separately, for opting out is regarded as violation of the law since it makes opting out or withdrawing consent more difficult.

#### Others
- The advertisement contents may be sent as images. However, if the name of the sender, contact information, methods for opting out or withdrawing consent are sent by being included in the image, it is regarded as violation of the law since filtering is impossible. 
- However, the push message is irrelevant to filtering, so it is allowed to indicate the required information in the format of an image.
